# Aliases are plain string replacements. The syntax is:
# alias string_to_replace=replacement_string
# There is no lexer involved so be aware.
# Trying to alias to little might break the syntax.
# Try to use token separators to clarify what you need. Also note that whitespaces
# in the definition DO COUNT.

# Substitutions try to replace a function with an alternate. The syntax is:
# subs function_definition=expression_definition
# a function definition goes like this:
# FunctionName(%param1,%param2,...%paramx)
# any text can be used after % as long as each param key is different
# The expression uses the same parameters '
# The complete expansion replaces the function and its parameters with the expression

# Substitutions are greedy so it is enough fo write foo(%a,%b%,%c)=foo(%a,foo(%b,%c))
# this will expand a query having foo(a,b,c,d) to foo(a,foo(b,foo(c,d)))

# Regex substitutions use ECMAScript syntax (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/)
# the syntax of a substitution is:
# regex rule==substitution
regex \[[_[:alnum:]\.\'\*\+\-\?[:space:]\\$]+\]\.currentmember\.LEVEL_NUMBER==CAST( $& AS INTEGER )

# Delimited aliases replace key with value for the text marked by start and stop. 
# If the pair start/stop occurs more than once then the replacement is tried on
# all occurences.
# the syntax is:
# delimited_alias start,stop,key,val
delimited_alias NON EMPTY, ON ,CrossJoin=NonEmptyCrossJoin

# Leave an empty line at the end
